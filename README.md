My fork of Luna. Has no affiliation with the parent repo. And user is responsible for what they do with the app. Does not come with services or addons. Use GitHub Issues for feature requests and bug reports

## Overview

This fork extends Luna with a broader feature set for anime, manga, light novels, downloads, and playback controls.

## Install

AltStore and SideStore users can add this source:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soupy-dev/Luna/main/altsource.json`

Releases are distributed as GitHub Release IPA assets. Before publishing a new source update, make sure `altsource.json` points to the uploaded `.ipa` and that the version, build, date, and `size` fields match the release asset.

5. Anime schedule data is integrated through AniList.
6. Automatic cache clearing is supported.
7. Backup and restore are included.
